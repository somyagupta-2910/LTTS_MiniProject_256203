## Abstract
 * With the ongoing corona virus pandemic, temperature scanning and sanitization of employees and other customers are done at the entrance of any institute as part of the Covid19 protocols. The project is all about managing the data and access the required information of all the people entering the premises and keep track of Covid19.
 * This project is an extension of a project done by me in May 2020, where I built a product which scans the tempearture of an employee, marks his attendance via a RFID based authentication system and sanitizes their hands.
