# Requirements
## Introduction
 * With the ongoing corona virus pandemic, temperature scanning and sanitization of employees and other customers are done at the entrance of any institute as part of the Covid19 protocols. The project is all about managing the data and access the required information of all the people entering the premises and keep track of Covid19.
 * This project is an extension of a project done by me in May 2020, where I built a product which scans the tempearture of an employee, marks his attendance via a RFID based authentication system and sanitizes their hands.

### Employee Management System Features and Benefits
Since the start of Covid19 pandemic, body temperature scanning and sanitization of hands has become a mandatory protocol which has to be followed everywhere. Wherever we go, our body temperature is checked so as to prevent the spread of coronavirus. In this new normal world of Covid19 people still have to go to their workplaces, in order to prevent the spread of virus, these Covid19 protocols are followed there too. A workplace consists of thounsands of employees and visitors. Each and every person visiting a workplace has to get thier temperature scanned and all these data have to be stored and managed. The major problem is that the amount of data collected is very large and improper management of this data can cause huge problems. TO overcome this, the Employee Management system can help us to organize and manage these huge amount of data in a very efficient way.

### Advantages
Employee Management System offers a lot of benefits to the workplaces during the testing times of Covid19. Some of the benfits are mentioned below:

### Better Tracking of Covid19
This Employee Management system helps us to keep track of the Covid19 virus at workplaces so as to avoid the spread of the virus.

### Efficient and quick scanning system
The product placed at the entrance of any workplace will ensure quick scanning, identification and sanitization of employees and other people, this in turn reduces time and manpower required for scanning the people at the workplace.

### Better Management of employee data
A workplace contains of thousands of employees working there and going in and out everyday, thereby there are lots of entries of each employee, thereby implementation of such a robust management system will help the workplaces to efficiently manage these large chunks of data.

## System:
### Pre-defined entities:
* Our system will interact with the following 
    * Temperature scanning product placed at the entrance
    * Employee Database

### Functionalities:
* Employee Management System applications:
    * Create a attendance record with temperature recordings
    * Update the employee data
    * Read the employee data
    * Creating a separate record for non-employees

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
* Employees and other people going for work at offices, banks and schools etc.

## What:
* Most of the workplaces are now operating with almost 100% of their workforce and therefore keeping track of the Covid19 virus at their respective workplace becomes a tedious process.

## When:
* The Covid19 virus began from February 2020 in India. After a brief lockdown, many offices, banks and other institutes opened up in the month of April 2020.

## Where:
* This pandemic has affected all the regions of India.

## How:
* Improper tracking and scanning of Covid19 virus at workplaces may cause a huge increase in the number of positive cases at workplaces which in turn affects the company and the people. Since the start of offices and other workplaces, there has been a spike in the coronovirus cases.
